# pickem

Project started in collaboration with [@jordangerads](https://github.com/jordangerads) to do the scoring for a football pick'em league we play in.
This is the front end, with the backend code [here](https://github.com/jordangerads/pickem-api).

To set up, create a `.env` file at the project root. A `.env.sample` can be copied and modified as needed.

API host is specified in `.env` file, with the current default hosted at [https://gci-pickem.herokuapp.com](https://gci-pickem.herokuapp.com).

To start the server in development mode, check out the repository then run the commands
```
    npm install
    npm run dev
```
To run the server in production mode, run the commands
```
    yarn [or npm install]
    yarn build [or npm run build]
    yarn start [or npm run start]
``` 

This app is deployed at [https://pickem-football.herokuapp.com](https://pickem-football.herokuapp.com).
