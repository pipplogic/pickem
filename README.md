# pickem

Project started in collaboration with [@jordangerads](https://github.com/jordangerads) to do the scoring for a football pick'em league we play in.
This is the front end, with the backend being hosted [here](https://github.com/jordangerads/pickem-api).

To start the server in development mode, check out the repository then run the commands
```
    npm install
    npm dev
``` 

API host is specified in `.env` file, with the current default hosted at [https://gci-pickem.herokuapp.com](https://gci-pickem.herokuapp.com).

This app is deployed at [https://pickem-football.herokuapp.com](https://pickem-football.herokuapp.com).
