# pickem

Project started in collaboration with [@jordangerads](https://github.com/jordangerads) to do the scoring for a football pick'em league we play in.
This is the front end, which relies on an  [API host](https://github.com/jordangerads/pickem-api).

## Setup

Create a `.env` file at the project root. The `.env.sample` can be copied and updated with your API authorization.

## Running the Server Locally

### Dev Mode

```
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

### Production mode

```
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start
```
